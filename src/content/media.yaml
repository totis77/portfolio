  tagline:  Simulating heterogeneous virtual crowds is essential for creating believable environments, particularly in scenarios like museum exhibitions where agents must exhibit a range of behaviors. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework capable of concurrently learning multiple agent behaviors—such as goal seeking, collision avoidance, environmental interaction, and grouping—within a single model. By dynamically adjusting the relative importance of each behavior during training, the system enables the creation of configurable agent profiles and generalizes to unseen scenarios with higher crowd densities, novel behavior combinations, and more complex layouts.
